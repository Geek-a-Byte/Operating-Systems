# Operating-Systems

### work of OS
- resourse allocation and deallocation 
- external device management
- core of OS is kernel
- we will use kernel by shell commands and shell scripts
- linux is an open source os.
- OS - windows / linux / MACOS
- Dual boot / bootable pendrive / VM 
### VM 
it runs an OS(ubuntu linux) as an application of currently installed OS(Windows).It creates a virtual environment, then we install the OS in that environment.
### User directory
- root/home/nazia
### Terminal Commands

1 . if we want to know the account we are logged into currently then :
```console 
whoami
```
2. print working directory 

```console 
pwd
```

```diff 
- by default (the first slash indicates root)/home/username/ in red
```

3. ```nazia@nazia: ~$``` : here the ~ sign means ```/home/username/```
4. ```cd``` takes us to ```/home/username/```
5. cd path
6. cd means change directory
7. absolute path - starts from root address
8. relative path - starts with respect to current folder
9. ```cd /``` - goes to the root
10. go back to previous folder ```cd ..```
11. we can write ~/Desktop instead of /home/Desktop, hence ~ is a replacement of /home
12. to make a new folder mkdir
13. To list information about directory or files : ls (only ls command will not show the hidden files) 
<pre>
This command contains some options.
■ -a [ do not hide entries starting with . ] , a means all files including hidden would be shown
■ -A [ do not list implied . and .. ] 
■ -h [ print sizes in human readable format ]
■ -l [ use a long listing format ]
■ -S [ sort by file size ]
</pre>
